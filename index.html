                        <li>Adapted quickly by transitioning to a new tech stack and becoming a major contributor to squad objectives. Was given commendations for successfully adapting to a new tech stack and was promoted within 6 months of hiring.</li>
                        <li>CI/CD deployment process needed standardization and was plagued by rollbacks 30% of the time.

                        <li>Was challenged to obtain knowledge and understanding of 3 distinct microservice API’s containing 1000’s of lines of code, due to the departure of senior developers.

                        <li>Refactored 2 .net API’s.
